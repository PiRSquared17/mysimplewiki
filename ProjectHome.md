**MyWiki** is a quick deployment, out-of-the-box Wiki solution for implementation in Unix servers

MyWiki is a compact, simple and fully usable solution that incorporates all the major traits of a wiki engine: creation, editing and deletion of pages, as well as searching for content.

By making use of tools readily available in Unix environments (bash, SQLite3, apache), MyWiki requires minimal aditional configuration, and no dependency installation.
